### Tips

**“Step of the timepoint”** refers to the step of the start timepoint sequence. (Similarly, the sequence of “0, 6, 12, 18,\~”, the step is 6 here). “The start timepoint” means the start time of each time interval. (In the NSCLC-ALK network, 0 is the start time of the time interval of 0-6, …, 60 is the start time of the time interval of 60 to the end).
